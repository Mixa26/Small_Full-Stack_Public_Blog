# Public Blog

This was a small homework project from uni. The goal was to make a small full-stack website which anyone could upload a blog to, and anyone could comment on these blogs. 
Tomcat was used to host the server, and this is a one page app created with bootstrap and native JS which means the page changing was done with JS dynamically.
Using this website is pretty straight forward, there are 3 screens in total so there's no need for explanation on usage.

The original homework documentation is provided in the "Web DomaÄ‡i 5.docx" file.
